The complete database is too large to upload here.  
If you clone/download this repository, download the database https://physionet.org/content/picsdb/1.0.0/ separately and put the indivudal files in this folder.
For each infant, there is a set of files. For Infant-1, for instance:
- infant1_ecg.atr
- infant1_ecg.dat
- infant1_ecg.hea
- infant1_ecg.qrsc
- infant1_resp.dat
- infant1_resp.hea
- infant1_resp.resp

Copy these files, and those of the other subjects into this folder.
